# First Laboratory Assignment: Basic Web Technologies
## Internet Applications Design and Implementation 2021/22 

### Introduction

This year's theme is a service to help on the management of its users reading habits. The core of our concern is a service that stores information about books, ratings of books and and the reading habits of its users. Users can collaboratively add information about books, report the ownership of a given book, the desire to read it, and the fact that they read it along with a rating, and a review. This is the general topic for this year, each assignment will add the details needed for each instalment.

Your first assignment is to write an HTML page for the website's home page that shows a list of books. You shall mimic the image provided as reference in the file `Homepage.pdf`, as closely as possible. You will use the provided JSON file, and submit a single HTML file which must include all css and javascript code. You are only allowed to use standard and raw HTML, CSS, and Javascript. No external libraries or modules are allowed. Its use will be penalized. The final goal in this first assignment is to load the data from the provided JSON file and dynamically build the HTML elements in the page. You may use the fetch API which is nowadays supported by all browsers to load the JSON file. Use (w3schools)[https://www.w3schools.com/] or (Mozilla Developer Documentation)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/] as references to your work (not stackoverflow).

Extra credit: You may also submit a personal interpretation of the same web page that gives a more modern and sophisticated look to the same web page.
